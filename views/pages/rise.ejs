      Mexico is a country rich in history and culture. The cultural richness and
      warmth of its people are reflected in typical Mexican clothing.
      <br />
      <br />
      Although typical Mexican clothing has had several periods of change, it
      has preserved its beauty and tradition. The production of typical Mexican
      clothing in recent years has increased its demand considerably worldwide
      because garments are made by hand. Their designs, embroidery, fabrics,
      wideness, comfortableness, and large cuts make them very attractive.
      <br /><br />
      The boom in clothing production goes hand in hand with the spread of
      traditions and their cultural diversity. This is part of what gives
      typical Mexican clothing such a special and unique touch.
      <br /><br />
      At present, everything is made industrially, so a garment is made in
      series; Typical Mexican clothing breaks with this pattern since each
      garment has a different embroidery, different colours, and each piece is
      unique. This is something that the consumer loves, that the garment that
      he acquires is unique and that no one has one equal to the one acquired.
      <br /><br />
      In a world where everything of natural origin is being used to a greater
      extent, typical Mexican clothing meets these requests; its fabrics such as
      cotton, linen, wool, and fibers such as agave and silk thread, as well as
      the dyes that are used, are natural. It is something that not only the
      foreigner seeks, the Mexican himself also seeks natural products.
      <br /><br />
      And of course, it is not only the hand-made clothing that has increased
      its production in Mexico but also accessories such as hats, bags, purses,
      belts, earrings, necklaces, huaraches, all this also handmade with a wide
      variety of materials and techniques.
      <br /><br />
      The fine huarache has been the type of traditional Mexican footwear for
      centuries. These huaraches have also been in high demand for being very
      comfortable and colourful. They have fostered the development of
      innovative designs, which have become among international designers of
      modern footwear.
